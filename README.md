# arduino-promicro-volume

A USB volume and mute button, made of:

* Arduino Pro Micro, which like a Leonardo is based on the already USB-capable ATmega32U4

* HW-040 rotary encoder

* A slightly widened version of the following case, to also allow for the slightly wider encoder's board 
  * https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2389583

* USB cable - stress-relieved by that case


* Third-party Arduino libraries 
  * HID-Project
  * BasicEncoder

* this code
